== 0.4.2 2008-10-14

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Fixed bug with rails irb loading when RAILS_GEM_VERSION is different from installed rails
  * added StandardError#message_filters and StandardError#backtrace_filters to _not_ open
    vim for certain messages or backtrace matches

    TODO: Expose a method for adding filters

== 0.4.1 2008-10-14

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Modified std_err_hooks.rb to know when the file loaded came from an <F12> in vim
    (loading buffer into irb).  If so, it will just switch back to the screen window
    with the original file open, and move the cursor to the erroring line
  * Writing the file in /tmp/ now keeps SCREEN window number and full path intact (though coded)

== 0.3.1 2008-10-13

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Added std_err_hooks.rb so that when on a console session, any errors encountered
    open up the files which errored in vim, with the cursor on the line which triggered
    the Exception
  * Tested on newgem, merb, and rails.  Full working (with vim-only)

== 0.2.1 2008-10-13

* 4 major enhancements:
  * Added <F12> keybinding in vim to load current vim buffer in irb and switch to it
  * Moved vim files to proper directories
  * Made a new ride-console script to make sure the debuuger (irb, window 1) opens 
    properly for non-rails/non-newgem apps (works on merb!)
  * Added .irbrc

== 0.0.1 2008-08-19

* 1 major enhancement:
