Documentation and support can be found at:
* http://trac.rubyists.com/trac.fcgi/ride/wiki/RIDE

== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby-based Integrated Development Environment combining GNU screen and
VIM to create a flexible environment for working on your projects.  It
also allows multiple users to work together (ala pairs-coding) or work
on different pieces of a project at the same time within the same IDE.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Uses screen to allow logical partitioning of pieces of a project, as
  well as multiple users to work together in the same space.
* Uses the powerful VIM text editor to work on source files and provide
  great syntax highlighting and code shortcuts (when available.)

== SYNOPSIS:

(Getting Started)
$ ride <project root>

(Getting to work)
$ script/editor

(Seeing the options)
$ script/editor --help

== REQUIREMENTS:

* screen
* vim (depends on file navigation)
* ruby (we use some ERb to make the templates work)
* gems - rubigen, hoe.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ride
* read the postinstall for instructions (prints after install)
